#### What is 'quantum'?
The term 'quantum' means the very small. Sub-atomic. The significance of this is that the way physical laws (the ones we are used to in our everyday lives; friction, heat and gravity), are very different, in the way things fundamentally work. Forces such as gravity are more likely to be based on electromagnetic effects from the spin of particles, and energy works in a way such that the forces generated by a particle are represented everywhere by the force's wave function, but only take effect one interaction and at one place at a time, like a particle. More on this later.

#### Representation
So how to we represent quantum interactions? By chance. That is the answer. Because the energy exists as a waveform, and we can often know exacly what the waveform is from measurements from the source of energy, or by configuring the source to produce a specific waveform. So we know what the waveform is; we know how much energy is contained (amplitude) and how it operates (frequency).
